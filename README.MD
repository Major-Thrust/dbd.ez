### Dev Note: This is still in beta, Join support server for any support, Big updates are coming!

## Usage Example

### Setup

```js
const discord = require("dbd.ez");

const client = new discord({
  token: "TOKEN", //Your Discord Bot Token
  prefix: "-",
});

client.command({
  name: "say",
  reply: "{args.all}",
  argsError: {
    1: "You must send atleast one arg",
  }, //unlike js where args start from 0 in dbd.ez args start from 1 for the sake of simplicity.
});
```

### Constants

Constants are to simplify your work, example:

```js
client.command({
  name: "ping",
  reply: "üèì Pong, API latency is {ping}ms",
});
```

here `{ping}` gets converted to actual API ping when bot replies

### Per-Command-Events

What are events?

When you use dbd.ez you will register a command with .command({}), we cannot run anything we want when a command is executed, here comes per-cmd-events, this will help you do any task when a command is executed, example:

```js
client.on("command-ping", (message) => {
  console.log("Ping command has been used!");
}); //The event is emitted along with discord.js message object

client.command({
  name: "ping",
  reply: "üèì Pong, API latency is {ping}ms",
}); //You must register the command like this for per-cmd-events to work
```

### Note: Since this package is very new, this is still in beta, we don't recommend you to use this until we release a stable release, stable release is v1 and above!
